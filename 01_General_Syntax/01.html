    <h1>Intro to JavaScript</h1>

    <h2>WTF IS JS Anyway, and Why do I care?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, or as it is known more formally, ECMAScript is a protocol that was originally written by the nice
    folks at Netscape,(Mozilla today) to allow for interactivity in markdown files on the internet. Back in the day,
    HTML - HyperText Markdown Language - was used by universities and government institutions to publish
    documentation and share it globally, on this fancy new thing called the "internet".</p>
    <p>While it started from humble beginnings, as personal computers became more and more powerful, migrating the
    workload for interactive markdown from servers became the norm. Today, while it's still common within some
    companies to use "thin client" applications, most of what you see on the internet is actually getting
    processed right there on your own machine! Thanks, JavaScript!</p>
    <p>JavaScript is many things, but keep in mind that despite it's name, it has absolutely nothing in common with
    Java! Java is a compiled, strictly-typed, object-oriented language. JavaScript however, is a loosely-typed,
    context-driven language. It does not compile in the normal sense, it is not formally object-oriented, and even
    though it is flexible enough to allow for many different coding practices, it IS NOT JAVA! It doesn't even do
    math in the same way!</p>
    <p>As we progress, it will become more obvious what JS is, and what it is not. For now, just remember that it
    was built originally for the web, and it is the most optimized way to create interactivity on the internet.</p>

    <h2>Contexts</h2>
    <h3>The Browser</h3>
    <p>For the majority of these sessions, we will be writing our code for use within the browser. Here, our code is
    executed as soon as each line of it is loaded. It loads our code from top-to-bottom, starting at the beginning
    of our document, i.e.: the first line in our topmost HTML file.</p>
    <p>We can also leverage a "REPL", which comes to us in the form of an execution console in the developer section
    . We will use this console a lot, and get to know the other developer tools available to us as these sessions
    progress.</p>
    <p>Our code is maintained in a specific scope which we will talk more about, known as the DOM (Document Object
    Model). Here, it is interpreted, compiled, (but not in the way you're probably thinking) and executed. It
    interacts with all the relevant and available touch points your browser has, such as the address bar, the
    page, cookies, and so on.</p>

    <h3>Cloud Systems</h3>
    <p>Some hosted applications try to distribute their processing responsibilities 50/50 between the browser and a
    server. There are a number of reasons as to why this is useful, but I won't waste time talking about that.
    Since we won't be coding against someone else's hosted app, all you need to know about this execution
    context, is that it has to interpret the client-side JS from a server, which can mean that it turns the code
    into a "string" then attempts to compile it through an application native to the server which recieved it. This
    can cause interesting problems, but it can also safeguard user data in more reliable ways without
    sacrificing performance.</p>

    <h3>Node.js</h3>
    <p>Ah, to be asynchronous! The most powerful aspect of JS, and why it's so much cooler than all the other
    languages, is that it is legitimately asynchronous!... if we write it to be, that is. That means that we can
    have it executing two different tasks simultaneously, regardless of the states of each other. They can even be
    dependent on each other, and still process separately. Additionally, these mutliple processes can all occupy
    the same thread, (and usually do)! Amazing stuff!</p>
    <p>Node leverages the power of async in a very special way, and comes along with many useful tools for building
    native system applications, just like you'd expect to see in Java or C#. It is considered one of the most
    important frameworks you can learn, if you plan on specializing in the language.</p>
    <p>Node, and thusly async programming is tricky to wrap your head around, but we'll cover it in some meaningful
    ways as we move forward.</p>
